# unet
Code for segmentation of 2d images utilizing the Unet neural network architecture. Initial testing considered detection of costa/rib-bones in cross-sectional
MRI image scans. Please see docs for an abstract explaining this test. 

Credit: The code is based on the main branch in https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet (should have been forked, I know, but I plan to rearrange the code...)
